This is the repository for my FPGA project of Digital Systems Design CPE 487 for the Fall 2021 semester.
The objective of this project is to translate Verilog code from a Music Box project in a [previous semester](https://github.com/jcristobal2391/cpe487F2020/tree/master/FPGA%20Project) into VHDL code. 
The code is based off a project posted on [fpga4fun.com](https://www.fpga4fun.com/MusicBox.html) that uses a Pluto FPGA board, a speaker, and a 1Kâ„¦ resistor. I will attempt to implement the DAC Pmod as seen in the DAC Siren lab of this course.
